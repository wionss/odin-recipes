    </p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups quick cooking oats</li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray with flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, 1 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, at least 2 to 3
        minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then mix in vanilla. Gradually mix in dry ingredients until well combined. Add
        oats and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Cover the bowl and chill dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Dip a large fork in
        water, then in sugar, and use to flatten each cookie, rewetting and resugaring as necessary.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown around the edges and centers are nearly set, 8 to 10 minutes,
        switching racks halfway through. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack
        to cool completely.</li>
